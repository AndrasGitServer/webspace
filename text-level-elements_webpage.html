    <h1>Text-Level Elements</h1>
    <p>
        Within each <strong>grouping element</strong> are <strong>text-level elements</strong>, 
        which mark phrases or characters within a paragraph. 
        Unlike <strong>sectioning</strong> or <strong>grouping elements</strong> that mark a self-contained block of content,
        <strong>text-level elements</strong> appear <mark>in line</mark> with the surrounding content and are known as 
        <mark>inline</mark> elements.
        For example, the italicized or boldface text in this paragraph is considered 
        inline content because it appears alongside the surrounding text. 
        Figure 1–16 describes some of the many text-level elements in HTML. 
    </p>

    <pre>
        Text-Level Elements are Inline Elements !
        Text-Level Elements are in-text formatting tags !
    </pre>
    
    <p>
        While most HTML tags are used to create elements, 
        HTML also provides <mark>in-text</mark> formatting tags
        to apply specific <mark>text-related styles</mark> to portions of text. 
        Examples of HTML text formatting such as:
        highlighting,
        bolding, 
        italic,
        underlining, 
        abbreviation,
        stricken text.
    </p>

    <mark>Highlighting !</mark>

    <!--
        What’s the difference? Semantics. 
        <strong> is used to indicate that the text is fundamentally or semantically
        important to the surrounding text, 
        while <b> indicates no such importance and simply represents text that should
        be bolded.
    -->

    <b>Bold Text Here</b>

    <h3>
        <q> It needs to be emphasized again that all of these stylistic choices 
            are not determined by the markup tags !                   <br>
            <em>they are default styles used by the browser ! </em>   <br>
            Different browsers and different devices might render these page elements differently.  <br> 
            To exert more control over your page’s appearance, you can apply a style sheet to the document.
